# AutoWrapEllipsisText

`AutoWrapEllipsisText` is a Flutter widget that automatically wraps and truncates text based on pixel constraints.  
It allows you to render dynamic text in tightly constrained spaces with precise control over wrapping and overflow.

Ideal for dashboards, cards, or any layout where text must fit within strict size limits.

- ‚úÇÔ∏è Truncates with ellipsis when text exceeds height or width
- üß† Automatically calculates `maxLines` if not specified
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance-optimized with internal character-width caching
- üéØ Compatible with all standard `Text` widget properties:
  - `style`, `maxLines`, `overflow`, `textAlign`, `softWrap`, `textDirection`, etc.

## Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example:

```dart

## Additional information

- This widget internally uses TextPainter to measure character widths and fit text within layout bounds.
- If the container is too small to render even a single character, it returns SizedBox.shrink().
